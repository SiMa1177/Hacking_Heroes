# Hacking_Heroes

# Description:
The Hacking Heroes project is a collection of Python scripts designed to showcase various programming concepts, including colored text printing, object-oriented programming, and unit testing. Each script serves as a demonstration of specific functionalities, providing a platform for learning and experimentation in Python.

# Installation:
To set up the project locally, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hacking_Heroes.git

   cd Hacking_Heroes
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage:
To run the individual scripts, use the following commands in your terminal:

1. For printing colored text:
   python Print_Coloured_Text.py

2. For the q13.py, q14.py, and q15.py scripts, execute:
   python q13.py
   python q14.py
   python q15.py

3. To test the functionality of the classes:
   python test.py

# File Descriptions:
1. Print_Coloured_Text.py: A script to print colored text in the terminal using the colorama library, demonstrating the use of foreground and background colors.
2. q13.py: A script showcasing a class structure and methods to handle basic operations for a person (or similar entity), allowing for initialization, greeting, and age increment.
3. q14.py: An extension of the functionalities in q13.py, adding new elements and improving upon the existing class structure.
4. q15.py: Further enhancement of the previous classes, introducing more complex features and methods for better usability.
5. tempCodeRunnerFile.py: A simplified class definition for a person, demonstrating object-oriented programming with methods for greeting and birthday simulation.
6. test.py: A comprehensive set of unit tests for the classes defined in tempCodeRunnerFile.py and other scripts, ensuring functionality and robustness of the code.
